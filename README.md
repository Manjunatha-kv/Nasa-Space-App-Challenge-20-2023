Managing Fire: Increasing Community-based Fire Management Opportunities
Our project aims to address the increasing wildfire threat by democratizing access to and utilization of NASA's satellite-derived fire data. We developed an app-based platform that integrates various technologies, including TensorRT, NumPy, PID Controller, CNN Model, open CV, and HTML, CSS, and Figma, to enable local communities to report fires or suspicious smoke in their vicinity, collect data from drones, and monitor and respond to wildfires effectively.

The app incorporates various features, such as:

A user-friendly interface for reporting fires and suspicious smoke
A real-time fire tracking system that leverages NASA's satellite data
A drone-based fire detection system that utilizes a CNN model to identify fires in thermal images
A PID controller to ensure the drone's stability and accuracy in tracking fires
This project is important because it seeks to improve wildfire resilience by empowering local communities to take an active role in fire management. The app provides a simple and accessible platform for reporting fires and tracking their spread, which can help to expedite the response time and minimize damage. Additionally, the drone-based fire detection system can be used to monitor remote areas that are difficult to reach by traditional means.

Overall, our project presents a novel and innovative approach to wildfire management that can help to protect communities and ecosystems from this growing threat.
